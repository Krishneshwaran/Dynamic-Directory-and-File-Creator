# 📂 Custom File Extension Project - `.myext`

Welcome to your custom file extension project! This README will guide you through the steps to create, implement, and test a custom `.myext` extension that can generate folders and files automatically. Let’s get started! 🎉

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project allows you to:
1. Define a folder and file structure in a `.myext` file.
2. Automatically create nested folders and files by simply opening the `.myext` file in a specified directory.

---

### 📋 Requirements
- 🐍 **Python** (for running the setup script)
- 🖥️ **Windows** (to associate the file extension with Python)

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Implement

### 1. **Create Your .myext File** 📄

1. Open your favorite text editor (like VS Code or Notepad).
2. Create a JSON file structure to define folders and files. Save it with a `.myext` extension.
3. 🎉 **Save** it as `example.myext`.

---

### 2. **Write the Python Script** 🐍

1. Create a new file named `create_structure.py`.
2. Write the script to read `.myext` files and create folders and files based on their structure.
3. Save the file! 🖫

---

### 3. **Test the Script** 🧪

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the script with your `.myext` file.
3. 🎉 Check the folder to see if the structure was created!

---

### 4. **Associate .myext Files with Python on Windows** 🔗

1. **Right-click** on any `.myext` file and select **Open with > Choose another app**.
2. Select your Python interpreter (`python.exe`) and check **Always use this app to open .myext files**.
3. **Double-click** the `.myext` file to test it! Your script will automatically run and create the folder structure wherever the `.myext` file is saved.

## 🌟 Enjoy!
Now you have a fully functional custom file extension!
